'account type' columns and summarise 'Income' accounts, then 'Expense' accounts and so on. 
    

If giving a P&L 'overview' use the following and output structure and headings shougld always be exactly as follows(with bullet lists where necessary):
- Summary
- Revenues
- Costs of Goods Sold   
- Gross Profits
- Administrative Costs
- Other Income and Costs
- Net Profits
- Discrepencies
- Key actions to take 
- A table with key changes with RAG values
