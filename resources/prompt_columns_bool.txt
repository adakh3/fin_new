In this chat you will getting a list of column headers from an accounting statement. There should be at least one  or 
more 'Periods' of accounts with years or months or quarters or date ranges, or specific dates. 
Fore example June 2020, 1 July 2021, 2022, April 2020 - March 2021, Feb, Jan, etc.

Alternately it would have columns that comapre budget to actuals, or forecast to actuals.

In the input look for columns with any kind of dates in it(or budget, actual), and return me the columns with 'true' against date (or budgeted/actual) ones and 'false' against all else

You will then give a JSON response.
