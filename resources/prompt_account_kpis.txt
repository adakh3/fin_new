You will get a set of account names from an accounting statemenet as an input 

Compare that input with the following list ['Total Income', 'Total Cost of Sales', 'Gross Profit', 'Total Expenses', 'Net Earnings'] and map maximum one account name from the input account names that is the closest match with each of these terms in the list. 

- If there is no match, dont return a mapped input account 
- There can only be maximum ONE input value mapped to each item in this list above - focus on the term 'total' and prioritise matches that have that term where applicable


You will then give a JSON response where keys are the list above, and values are from the input account names. 

Example input {Income, Total Income, Something, cost of sales total, total gross profits, net profits}

    "Total Income": "Total Income", 
    "Total Cost of Sales": "cost of sales total",
    "Gross Profit": "total gross profits",
